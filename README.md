# Homework-1

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

changed first div to header, then nested div to nav (changed .header div classes to .header nav in css file)
changed div around main image to figure tag
changed the next div for the main three blocks of text to the main tag, then changed the three nested divs to the section tag
changed the next div for the side info to the aside tag, then changed the three nested divs to the section tag
changed the final div into the footer tag


WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

cleaned up html with good indents to notate structure and spaces between sections of code


WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

added alt text to describe images (basically denoting the headers associated with the images)


WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

css elements reordered to follow the same sequence as html file


WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

changed title to Horiseon Website
